    <img width="90%" title="mt32-pi - Baremetal synthesizer system" src="images/mt32pi_logo.svg">
</h1>

- A work-in-progress baremetal MIDI synthesizer for the Raspberry Pi 3 or above, based on [Munt], [FluidSynth] and [Circle].
- Turn your Raspberry Pi into a dedicated emulation of the [famous multi-timbre sound module][Roland MT-32] used by countless classic MS-DOS, PC-98 and Sharp X68000 games!
- üÜï Add your favorite [SoundFonts][SoundFont] to expand your synthesizer with [General MIDI], [Roland GS], or even [Yamaha XG] support for endless MIDI possibilities.
- üÜï Includes General MIDI and Roland GS support out of the box thanks to [GeneralUser GS] by S. Christian Collins.
- No operating system, no complex Linux audio configuration; just super-low latency audio.
- Easy to configure and ready to play from cold-boot in a matter of seconds.
- The perfect companion for your vintage PC or [MiSTer FPGA] setup.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Project status

<img title="mt32-pi running on the Raspberry Pi 3 A+ with the Arananet PI-MIDI HAT." width="280rem" align="right" src="images/mt32pi_pimidi.png">

- Tested on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+, B, and B+.
  * Pi 2 works, but only with concessions on playback quality.
  * Pi 0 and 1 are unfortunately too slow, even with an overclock.
- PWM headphone jack audio.
  * Quality is known to be poor (aliasing/distortion on quieter sounds).
  * It is not currently known whether this can be improved or not.
- [I¬≤S Hi-Fi DAC support][I¬≤S Hi-Fi DACs].
  * This is the recommended audio output method for the best quality audio.
- MIDI input via [USB][USB MIDI interfaces] or [GPIO][GPIO MIDI interface] MIDI interfaces.
- [Configuration file] for selecting hardware options and fine tuning.
- [LCD status screen support][LCD and OLED displays] (for MT-32 SysEx messages and status information).
- Simple [physical control surface][control surface] using buttons and rotary encoder.
- [MiSTer FPGA integration via user port][MiSTer FPGA user port connection].
- Network MIDI support via [macOS native network MIDI][macOS network MIDI], [rtpMIDI] on Windows, or [rtpmidid] on Linux.
- FTP access to files and auto-update is _planned_.

## ‚ú® Quick-start guide

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases] section.
2. Extract contents to a blank [FAT32-formatted SD card][SD card preparation].
    * Read the [SD card preparation] wiki page for hints on formatting an SD card correctly (especially under Windows).
    * If you are updating an old version, you can just replace the `kernel*.img` files. The other boot files will not change often; but keep an eye on the [changelog] just in case.
3. For MT-32 support, add your MT-32 or CM-32L ROM images to the `roms` directory - you have to provide these for copyright reasons.
    * You will need at least one control ROM and one PCM ROM.
    * For information on using multiple ROM sets and switching between them, see the [MT-32 synthesis] wiki page.
    * The file names or extensions don't matter; mt32-pi will scan and detect their types automatically.
4. Optionally add your favorite SoundFonts to the `soundfonts` directory.
    * For information on using multiple SoundFonts and switching between them, see the [SoundFont synthesis] wiki page.
    * Again, file names/extensions don't matter.
5. Edit the `mt32-pi.cfg` file to enable any optional hardware (Hi-Fi DAC, displays, buttons). Refer to [the wiki][mt32-pi wiki] to find supported hardware.
    * **MiSTer users**: Read the [MiSTer setup] section of the wiki for the recommended configuration, and ignore the following two steps.
6. Connect a [USB MIDI interface][USB MIDI interfaces] or [GPIO MIDI circuit][GPIO MIDI interface] to the Pi, and connect some speakers to the headphone jack.
7. Connect your vintage PC's MIDI OUT to the Pi's MIDI IN and (optionally) vice versa.
